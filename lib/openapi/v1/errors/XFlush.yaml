  This header is optional. Default is false to just append it to the _write ahead log_ (WAL). 
  Depending on the servers configuration, this may take the entire commit window (default is 1 hour).
  If true, a database flush is enforced which may block and make changes immediately visible. 
  It will compact and shard the data and write it atomically into the servers filesystem. 
  Afterwards, the device index is reloaded and the data can be read back.
  Depending on the load, this may cause massive performance penalties and may even cause timeouts, especially
  when used concurrently or if the machine is already under load or the _write ahead log_ is huge.
  
  If true, the response code is 204 on success, otherwise a 202.
