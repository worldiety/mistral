  type:
    type: string
    format: uri
    nullable: false

      Consumers MUST use the 'type' string as the primary identifier for
      the problem type. This must not be a URL but may also be a URI.
  title:
    type: string
    default: ""
    nullable: false
    description: |
      A short, human-readable summary of the problem
      type.  It SHOULD NOT change from occurrence to occurrence of the
      problem, except for purposes of localization.

  status:
    type: integer
    nullable: false
    format: int32
    description: The HTTP status code.

  detail:
    type: string
    nullable: false
    default: ""
    description: |
      A human-readable explanation specific to this
      occurrence of the problem.

  instance:
    type: string
    nullable: false
    format: uri
    description: |
      A URI reference that identifies the specific
      occurrence of the problem. It contains a random
      uuid to identify each problem individually and which
      can be used to trace within the log files. Intentionally,
      this cannot be dereferenced to not leak implementation details
      and therefore increase the attack surface.
