  - unit
  - aggregation
  - scale
properties:
  unit:
    type: string
    description: |
      The unit of the value. This is nearly arbitrary and is usually derived from physical base units.
      Typical examples are kWh, rpm or km/h.
  aggregation:
    type: string
    enum: [ max, min, avg, sum, none, other ]
    description:
      A data aggregation takes a bunch of values and applies a non-inverse function on it.
      This always means that there is a loss of information.
      For example, the typical 10 minute or 15 minute values have been probably aggregated
      from a much faster source, like a 16kHz oscilloscope sampling.
  scale:
    type: integer
    format: int64
    description: |
      mistral can only process integers. 
      So in case of floats or decimals this indicates the scale to divide or multiply the numbers before inserting or after querying.
      This always has to be done explicitly to match the actual defined _unit_.
