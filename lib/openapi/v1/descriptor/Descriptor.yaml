  A Descriptor defines the nature of a time series. 
  A _time series_ is defined as a series of key-value tuples, where the key is a unique Unix time stamp and the value is an integer.
  All tuples are ordered ascending based on the time stamp.
  The nature of a Descriptor must be constant for all associated time series tuples over all time.
  To programmatically decide, which kind of calculations are valid, a Descriptor contains various meta information to describe what and how the value must be interpreted.
  A Descriptor must be quantifiable and must have a unit.
  Typically, a Descriptor is a _physical quantity_ or a business Descriptor like a _key performance indicator_.

      Arbitrary optional map of any kind of attributes.
      This data holder can be used, to attach external or internal meta data to improve data interoperability
      or synchronizations within your middleware.
      Mistral never evaluates this and custom kernels should not do that either.
