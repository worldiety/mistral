      This endpoint resides in the dangerzone because it is not entirely protected
      by transactions and very I/O intensive. 
      This endpoint was created to support refactorings of your middleware and 
      should otherwise never be used.
      
      In all buckets including the descriptor meta data and time series data is removed. 
      The current implementation is always blocking and returns a 204 on success. 
      If the service crashes or fails with a 500, better start consulting your backup.
