      The engine has been optimized to process equidistant timestamps.
      However, arbitrary 64 bit keys can be processed but will degrade performance and efficiency seriously. 
      The worst case scenario is to store random numbers.
      All build-in functions expect a timestamp anyway.

  unit:
    type: string
    nullable: false
    enum: [ seconds ]
    description: |
      The unit of the key must be in _seconds_. 
      Although, the storage engine supports just a 64 bit signed integer, all build-in time-based pipeline functions
      expect a second precision.
