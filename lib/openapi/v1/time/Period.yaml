  A Period describes the base interval of a sampling.
  The following intervals are specified:
    * `10m`: the metric value consists of whatever has been measured within a constant interval of 600 seconds.
    * `15m`: the metric value consists of whatever has been measured within a constant interval of 900 seconds.
    * `daily (deprecated)`: the metric value consists of whatever has been measured within a time zone specific interval.
       It is deprecated because this indicates that a time zone dependent data aggregation has already happened which
       makes sane post-processing nearly impossible. Use a compute [kernel](#tag/kernels) and a variable
       timezone on a constant interval like 10m. E.g. it is not possible anymore, to aggregate into a month of another
       timezone.
     * `monthly (deprecated)`: the metric value consists of whatever has been measured within a time zone specific interval.
       It is deprecated because this indicates that a time zone dependent data aggregation has already happened which
       makes sane post-processing nearly impossible. Use a compute [kernel](#tag/kernels) and a variable
       timezone on a constant interval like 10m. E.g. it is not possible anymore, to aggregate into a year of another
       timezone.
     * `none`: the metric value has been measured or calculated without any significant duration.
       This is only and always the case for samplings of `instant` or `levelBegin` or `levelEnd`.
  
  Additional intervals may be standardized later. 
  Implementations must accept non-standardized intervals, which may be passed and evaluated by a custom compute [kernel](#tag/kernels).
