  A Resolution describes the base interval of a sampling.
  The following intervals are specified:
    * `10m`: the metric value consists of whatever has been measured within a constant interval of 600 seconds.
    * `15m`: the metric value consists of whatever has been measured within a constant interval of 900 seconds.
    * `daily (deprecated)`: the metric value consists of whatever has been measured within a time zone specific interval.
       It is deprecated because this indicates that a time zone dependent data aggregation has already happened which
       makes sane post-processing nearly impossible. Use a compute [kernel](#tag/kernels) and a variable
       timezone on a constant interval like 10m.
     * `monthly (deprecated)`: the metric value consists of whatever has been measured within a time zone specific interval.
       It is deprecated because this indicates that a time zone dependent data aggregation has already happened which
       makes sane post-processing nearly impossible. Use a compute [kernel](#tag/kernels) and a variable
       timezone on a constant interval like 10m.
  
  Additional intervals may be standardized later. 
  Implementations must accept non-standardized intervals, which may be passed and evaluated by a custom compute [kernel](#tag/kernels).
