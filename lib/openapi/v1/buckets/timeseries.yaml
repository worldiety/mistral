    summary: Insert, append or update metric data.
    description: |
      A post will create a device, if required. Given time series data is either appended, inserted or already existing
      values are updated. The data is only available after a flush, which may usually only happen once an hour. However, for
      testing purposes or if you are going to calculate carefully and insert huge amounts of data (gigabytes), you can flush
      the data explicitly.
      
      **Warning**: you should never put a single value for all of your devices and call flush for each.
      This will hurt your servers performance seriously! Rule of thumb: if you are not sure, do not use the _X-Flush_ parameter.
      
      The X axis of the dataset is stored as a strict monotonic arbitrary integer.
      However, group functions (like group by day) interpret the value
      as a Unix timestamp in seconds.
